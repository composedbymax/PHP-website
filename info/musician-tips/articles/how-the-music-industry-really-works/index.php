                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The music industry has always been about balancing artistic expression and commercial reality. For a long time, this world was shaped by record labels, which acted as gatekeepers between artists and the public. But the advent of digital and streaming platforms has fundamentally shifted this dynamic, altering how music is made, sold, and listened to. Let's take a closer look at how the music industry operates, past and present.</p>

                <section id="the-age-of-record-labels">
                    <h2>The Age of Record Labels</h2>
                    <p>For decades, record labels held the reins of the music world. They controlled every step in an artist's journey, from production and promotion to distribution and licensing. Labels would “sign” artists, covering costs and organizing tours. In return, they took a sizable cut, often much more than most fans realize. The setup was simple: labels had the resources, and artists needed their support to reach the masses.</p>
                    <p>This structure led to a wealth of iconic albums, but it also left many artists bound to restrictive contracts, with only a fraction of the revenue they generated. Labels maintained an iron grip on distribution, and if you weren’t signed, good luck getting your music heard outside of local gigs and word of mouth.</p>

                    <h2>Rise of Digital and Streaming</h2>
                    <p>With the internet came a cultural earthquake. Suddenly, anyone could upload a song, and platforms like iTunes, Napster, and eventually Spotify allowed fans to access music instantly. The new dynamic reduced labels’ control, opening the door for artists to self-publish. But while the internet democratized distribution, it also complicated the economics of music.</p>
                    <p>Today, streaming dominates, with billions of streams daily. This has introduced micro-revenue models, where every stream counts for a fraction of a cent, a far cry from the lucrative album sales of the past. Yet, streaming also increased accessibility: artists can connect with fans globally, building audiences without gatekeepers.</p>

                    <h2>The New Artist-Label Dynamic</h2>
                    <p>Today’s artists have options. They can still sign with labels, but many choose self-publishing or work with smaller, indie labels that provide more control and better revenue shares. Record labels are adapting, offering "360 deals" where they take a share from tours, merchandise, and endorsements in addition to music sales.</p>
                    <p>While labels still hold sway, especially for artists aiming for mainstream stardom, artists today have a better shot at creative freedom and financial independence, especially those savvy with social media.</p>

                <section id="streaming-royalties-and-challenges">
                    <h2>Streaming Royalties and Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Streaming may sound like a win-win for artists and listeners, but in practice, the economics are thorny. Royalties from streaming platforms vary widely, with artists earning fractions of a cent per stream. Only top-streaming artists make significant money from platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, while lesser-known musicians often struggle.</p>
                    <p>This issue has sparked debates over “fair pay” in music. Some platforms, like Bandcamp, offer alternatives by allowing fans to directly support artists, while other startups promise fairer models.</p>

                    <h2>Future of Music</h2>
                    <p>As the industry continues to evolve, technology will likely drive further shifts. Blockchain platforms propose decentralized music models, promising better royalties. AI is experimenting with new forms of music production, and VR concerts hint at the future of live music. Ultimately, the music industry’s story is one of constant adaptation, shaped by changing technology, listener demands, and, crucially, artists’ resilience in the face of it all.</p>
                    <p>The internet may have shaken up the old record label model, but one thing remains true: the drive to create and share music is stronger than ever.</p>
